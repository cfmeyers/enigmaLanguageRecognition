enigmaLanguageRecognition
=========================
langRecTest will try your mask on a set of 1000 different gibberish (i.e. non-English) 74-character strings.
It will return the percentage of false positives as well as how many milliseconds it took to run the test on all 1000 strings.

The test method must return false if it thinks the input string is *not* English, true otherwise.
